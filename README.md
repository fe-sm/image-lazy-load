prevent all pictures loaded at one time, so with this image lazy loading library, when the 
picture is located in the visual area to load pictures, in the loading process can be set delay 
time, when the scroll is too fast do not load, stay longer than the delay time. Will continue to
load pictures, This loading library is suitable for the case where there are multiple modules loading the image.
scrolling in their respective areas will only affect the region of the picture load
